**WARNING: this post contains descriptions of rape and detailed discussion of sexual violence.**

It is something of a running joke among my friends that I am interested in the law of consent. Sexual consent in particular is interesting, because the discussion can be quite nuanced. Sexual acts hold a special place in society and therefore are treated differently to other acts. There are myriad topics there which will be explored in other posts.

This post is not about nuance. This post is about the recent decision of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in *[Oklahoma v RZM][rzm]* (PDF link to summary opinion).

RZM was to stand trial for "forcible oral sodomy" pursuant to [21 O.S.2011 § 888][s888]. While I'll discuss that law a bit more in a moment, the undisputed facts are that the then-17-year-old RZM drove home the victim after a night of drinking. The victim was intoxicated. RZM penetrated the victim's mouth with his penis.

Although the extent of the victim's intoxication is disputed, the prosecution case is that the victim was in fact unconscious because of her intoxication.

Before the trial commenced, the charge was dismissed pursuant to a motion by the defendant. In dismissing the matter the court of first instance found that "forcible sodomy" cannot occur where the victim is so intoxicated as to be completely unconscious at the time of the alleged offence.

The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeal unanimously upheld that law.

This is, if you'll pardon the language, a fucking disgrace.

I'd like to begin by looking at the wording of [21 O.S.2011 § 888][s888]. That provides that

> Every person who forces another person to engage in the detestable and abominable crime against nature, pursuant to Section 886 of this title, upon conviction, is guilty of a felony...

Section 886 is a separate offence relating to a person who is

> ...guilty of the detestable and abominable crime against nature, committed with mankind or with a beast...

So, what is "the detestable and abominable crime against nature"? It's not defined in the statute, although section 887 helpfully informs us that:

> Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime against nature.

To determine what that crime actually is, we go back to *[Berryman v Oklahoma][berryman]*, a 1955 decision. The following quotes are particularly instructive; I've omitted citations.

{{< longquote >}}
¶8 ... Counsel for the accused cites cases which sustain his contention that the act of sodomy as known to the common law was defined as the copulation per anus of a man with another man or with a woman or the copulation of a man or a woman with a brute animal. The courts who so hold go back to the statutes of Henry VIII's time which prohibited buggery with man or beast under penalty of death and buggery included only genitalanal contact between man and man or between man and woman and what is now termed bestiality, which is genital contact with animals. It did not include fellatio (oral genital contact) or cunnilingus (oral vaginal contact).

¶9 Because of the omissions of the statute of the 1500's a defendant convicted of sodomy by an English court in 1817 for an act of fellatio accomplished with a boy 7 years of age was directed to apply for a pardon. The judges of England had met and decided that these facts did not constitute the crime of sodomy. Some American courts felt compelled to follow the authority of this case but the majority of the courts who have considered the matter have interpreted their sodomy and crime against nature statutes so as to prohibit fellatio. The Oklahoma statute does not mention sodomy but is directed at the "abominable crime against nature" which would be more comprehensive than sodomy as defined by the common law. The states which have statutes similar to ours are virtually unanimous in holding that it prohibits oral genital contact (fellatio).

The court goes on to quote *State v Start*, 65 Or. 178, 132 P. 512:

{{< longquote >}}
The rule at common law was that: "All unnatural carnal copulation whether with man or beast seems to come under the notion of sodomy." In the order of nature the nourishment of the human body is accomplished by the operation of the alimentary canal, beginning with the mouth and ending with the rectum. In this process food enters the first opening, the mouth, and residuum and waste are discharged through the nether opening of the rectum. The natural functions of the organs for the reproduction of the species are entirely different from those of the nutritive system. It is self-evident that the use of either opening of the alimentary canal for the purpose of sexual copulation is against the natural design of the human body. In other words, it is an offense against nature. There can be no difference in reason whether such an unnatural coition takes place in the mouth or in the fundament at one end of the alimentary canal or the other. The moral filthiness and iniquity against which the statute is aimed is the same in both cases. Each is rightfully included in the true scope and meaning of the common-law definition quoted above from Hawkins.

And thus the rule is settled. That "detestable and abominable crime against nature" includes any oral or anal intercourse.

Technically such sexual activity is per se prohibited by section 886, though [*Lawrence v Texas*][lawrence] would make the law unconstitutional to that extent.

Okay, so we have a "detestable and abominable crime against nature", that is to say penetration of the mouth with a penis.

How then can the Court not have been satisfied that the victim in RZM was not forced to engage in that act?

The Court considered the question settled by reference to [*Leftwich v State*][leftwich], a 2015 case about bribing a person to cause them to withdraw their candidacy for the state legislature.

In *Leftwich*, the Court found that statutes ought be interpreted in accordance with what is reasonable.
