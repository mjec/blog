**Note:** This post discusses sexual violence.

I have just listened to [a fantastic episode of NPR’s *Code Switch* podcast](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/08/24/491088359/nate-parkers-past-his-present-and-the-future-of-birth-of-a-nation-episode-14) all about Nate Parker, director of *The Birth of a Nation*.

For those who don’t know (as I didn’t), Parker was tried for and acquitted of rape, in circumstances where the victim was allegedly too intoxicated to consent. A friend of his was initially convicted of sexually assaulting the victim as part of the same incident, though that conviction was quashed for lack of competent representation. No retrial was held.

Parker’s legal culpability aside, this was clearly an incredibly traumatic event for the victim. She attempted suicide within a few months of the rape, dropped out of college, struggled with addition and eventually died from suicide in 2010, twelve years later. Her son was eight when she died.

There is a lot to unpack in this story, including the role of race in the handling of the accusation and its resurfacing this year; the deep and ongoing difficulty with the justice system, and how it fails especially black men and victims of sexual violence; the way that Parker has responded this year; and what this means for what is potentially otherwise a very important film for America, namely *The Birth of a Nation*.

These issues are complex and difficult and should be talked about. You should listen to the *Code Switch* episode I linked to above to hear some of that discussion. But I don’t want to talk more about this particular case. I want to talk about a principle that comes from one small aspect of it. I want to talk about whether it is possible to like art produced by artists who are awful people.

I want to start by examining this idea that there are awful people. I tend to think that people contain multitudes; that bad acts done by people don’t make people bad. But there’s some limit to this ideology. In particular, it seems obvious that we should not support or reward people who engage in bad acts. I wouldn't give my money to Donald Trump, not because he's irredeemable as a human being but because he'd spend that money promoting racism.

While my thinking today was triggered by the discussion of Nate Parker, I'd like to look at a less complicated example, and one a little more familiar to me. I want to talk about Woody Allen.

I have watched and enjoyed many Woody Allen films, from *Annie Hall* to *Midnight in Paris*, *Manhattan* to *Bananas*; though I couldn't get through more than the first ten minutes of *Purple Rose of Cairo*. I really enjoy some of Woody Allen's stand-up comedy. And he's an important icon in a culture that's important to me: I'm a white jewish guy who lives in New York City (and I was keen on that culture before I lived in New York; my father was a New Yorker and solidly a Baby-Boomer New York Jew).

Woody Allen is also someone who has, we can at the very least assume for the purpose of this discussion, sexually abused at least one member of his family. His particular brand of neurotic self-deprecating comedy is a thin veil over a deep and dangerous narcissism.

There are other examples, of course. Polanski and Picasso come immediately to mind. But for a moment let's stick with Allen.

One thing that makes this example nice to use is that giving him money doesn't mean he'll spend it on abusing children.
