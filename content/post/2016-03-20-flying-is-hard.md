I have [a place to live](http://osm.org/go/Zct~Bt2q?layers=N&node=158809359). I have tickets. I have [a purpose](https://recurse.com/), starting 28 March. Now I just need to get there.

I always forget how much effort is involved in travelling. I have the rest of the day to pack my things and then I leave the house around 4am tomorrow. I'll arrive at my temporary accommodation about thirty hours later (assuming no delays).

Packing itself is hard. There is a lot just in deciding what to take (and what to take carry-on). Then we get to the process of fitting it all into a suitcase, or deciding what to exclude when it doesn't fit.

On the plane I am planning to do some coding (just to get myself in the swing of things). There are a number of bug fixes and enhancements to [the <abbr title="Tasmanian Debating Union">TDU</abbr> website](https://tdu.org.au/) which are good candidates. I'll take some TV. Maybe a book. Maybe I'll try to sleep, though I expect the combination of excitement and aircraft will make that difficult.

It really hasn't sunk in yet that I'm going. I think that emotional journey (gross, I know) will be as tough as anything else. I might have a little cry on the plane, you never know. Maybe when I arrive. Maybe wandering through a park a week from now. It'll happen though. And in my own true style, I will [definitely](http://mjec.blogspot.com) [blog](https://me.mjec.net/) [about it](http://mjec.tumblr.com/).

Now that I've figured out everything set-up wise, aside from some clothes shopping (seriously, it turns out I only have like one pair of casual trousers that I like) I don't know what I'll do my first week in <del>the big apple</del> <del>NYC</del> <del>the City of Angels</del> that foreign place I'm going to. There's so much to do, and I need to do some of it. If only because I might not have time later.

There's a bunch of boring stuff I need to do (banking, establishing residency, registering to vote). There's got to be some exciting stuff too though. I'm thinking I might start with muesums and art galleries. My boss suggested the opera and a Harlem jazz club. Another suggestion was pancakes in a diner during the wee hours. Why not both, right?

I'm going to try to blog every day from now on (timezones mean I will skip what is the Australian 21 March). Often this will be cool technical stuff (e.g. talking about the cool [dark corners of unicode](https://eev.ee/blog/2015/09/12/dark-corners-of-unicode/) article I saw today). Sometimes it will be personal. I'll use [tags](/tags/) to make it easier for you to <del>stalk me</del> track what you're interested in.

My posts might not always have an actual conclusion or point.
