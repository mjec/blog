My first day of [RC](https://recurse.com) is today. I've been here for not quite four hours and so far:

 * I have had conversations about mathematics education, the law and artificial intelligence

 * I listened in on a conversation about graph theory

 * I have met a number of awesome people from awesome places

 * I have had a tongue-in-cheek vim vs emacs argument (vim 4 lyf!)

 * I have been complimented on my tshirt at least three times

 * I had some delicious steamed buns for lunch, which cost $2.10 (*in total*)

So, that's all pretty cool. Like, very cool.

The environment here is something a little unlike anything I've seen before. The lack of direction is actually fantastic; it means that you get to talk to fantastic people about anything. I was worried about this to be honest; I'm not great at meeting new people. It turns out that's really easy though. There's 'just enough' structured activity to make it easy to start conversations.

There's also a chat system which runs constantly. Being a bunch of computer nerds, this is a big win. Everyone is always there.

They also have a banner (not disimilar to [this](https://www.hand-made.com.au/item_images/9101_1398851846_1.jpg)) which says "algebraic data types".

I'm going to fit in here.
